      Warning! The Openstack provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
      high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
      will be silently ignored.

    config:
      password_required: |-
        A password is required.

      keypair_name_required: |-
        Warning! You have specified ssh.private_key_path in your Vagrant configuration.
        but nor keypair_name neither public_key_path are present. The openstack provider
        will automatically generate a new keypair and your configuration option
        ssh.private_key_path will be overriden
      private_key_missing: |-

        public_key_path is set in Vagrantfile
      ssh_username_deprecated: |-
        ssh_username provider config is deprecated for vagrant-openstack provider.
        If you are using it, it will continue to work but we recommend to switch to the
        standard vagrant configuration option `config.ssh.username` instead
      ssh_username_required: |-
        vagrant standard configuration option `ssh.username` is required

      bad_authentication_endpoint: |-
        Bad authentication endpoint.
      create_bad_state: |-
        While creating the server, it transitioned to an unexpected
        state: '%{state}', instead of properly booting. Run `vagrant status`
        to find out what can be done about this state, or `vagrant destroy`
        if you want to start over.
      multiple_api_version: |-
        Multiple version found for %{api_name} API

        %{version_list}

        the provider's property '%{url_property}'.
      no_matching_flavor: |-
        No matching flavor was found! Please check your flavor setting
        to make sure you have a valid flavor chosen.
      no_matching_image: |-
        No matching image was found! Please check your image setting to
        make sure you have a valid image chosen.
      sync_method_error: |-
        Value '%{sync_method_value}' is not allowed for 'sync_method' configuration parameter. Valid values are 'rsync' and 'none'
      rsync_error: |-
        There was an error when attemping to rsync a share folder.

        Command '%{cmd}' does not required any argument.
      unrecognized_arg_for_command: |-
        Argument '%{arg}' unrecognized for command '%{cmd}'.
      unable_to_resolve_floating_ip: |-
        Vagrant was unable to resolve a floating ip to communicate with your OpenStack instance. Please specify in your Vagrantfile either `floating_ip` or `floating_ip_pool`.
      unable_to_resolve_ip: |-
        Vagrant was unable to resolve a valid ip to ssh on your OpenStack instance.
      unable_to_resolve_ssh_key: |-

      ssh_username_missing: |-
        Vagrant was unable to resolve which ssh username to use to connect to the machine. Please provide config parameter `ssh.username`
      instance_not_found: |-
        Vagrant was unable to find the OpenStack instance used for your vagrant machine.
        This can happen when the instance has been deleted via OpenStack APIs or OpenStack
        Dashboard instead of using vagrant commands.
        We recommend using the command `vagrant openstack reset` to reset
        vagrant to a clear state

    states:
      short_active: |-
        active 
      long_active: |-
        The server is up and running. Run `vagrant ssh` to access it.
      short_build: |-
        building
      long_build: |-
        The server is currently being built. You must wait for this to
        complete before you can access it. You can delete the server, however,
        by running `vagrant destroy`.
      short_error: |-
        error
      long_error: |-
        The server is in an erroneous state. Contact your OpenStack administrator
        or destroy the machine with `vagrant destroy`.
      short_hard_reboot: |-
        hard reboot
      long_hard_reboot: |-
        The server is hard rebooting. This is equivalent to pulling the power plug
        on a physical server, plugging it back in, and rebooting it.
      short_password: |-
        password reset
      long_password: |-
        The password is being reset on the server.
      short_reboot: |-
        reboot
      long_reboot: |-
        The server is in a soft reboot state. A reboot command was passed to the operating system.
      short_rebuild: |-
        rebuild
      long_rebuild: |-
        The server is currently being rebuilt from an image.
      short_rescue: |-
        rescue
      long_rescue: |-
        The server is in rescue mode.
      short_resize: |-
        resize
      long_resize: |-
         Server is performing the differential copy of data that changed during
         its initial copy. Server is down for this stage.
      short_revert_resize: |-
        revert resize
      long_revert_resize: |-
        The resize or migration of a server failed for some reason. The destination
        server is being cleaned up and the original source server is restarting.
      short_shutoff: |-
        shutoff
      long_shutoff: |-
        The virtual machine (VM) was powered down by the user, but not through the
        OpenStack Compute API. For example, the user issued a shutdown -h command
        from within the server instance. If the OpenStack Compute manager detects
        that the VM was powered down, it transitions the server instance to the
        SHUTOFF status. If you use the OpenStack Compute API to restart the instance,
        the instance might be deleted first, depending on the value in the
        shutdown_terminate database field on the Instance model.
      short_suspended: |-
        suspended
      long_suspended: |-
        The server is suspended, either by request or necessity. This status appears
        for only the following hypervisors: XenServer/XCP, KVM, and ESXi.
      short_unknown: |-
        unknown
      long_unknown: |-
        The state of the server is unknown. Contact your cloud provider.
      short_verify_resize: |-
        verify resize
      long_verifiy_resize: |-

      short_suspending: |-
        suspending
      long_suspending: |-
        The server is active and currently suspending, either by request or necessity. 
      short_resuming: |-
        resuming 
      long_resuming: |-

      short_spawning: |-
        spawning
      long_spawning: |-
        The server is not created yet but is currently spawning by request. 
      short_deleting: |-
        deleting
      long_deleting: |-
