[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider)

This is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) 1.1+ plugin that adds a
[Openstack Cloud](http://www.openstack.org/software/) provider to Vagrant,
allowing Vagrant to control and provision machines within Openstack
cloud.

**Note:** This plugin was originally forked from [mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace)

## Features

* Boot Openstack Cloud instances.
* SSH into the instances.
* Provision the instances with any built-in Vagrant provisioner.
* Minimal synced folder support via `rsync`.

## Usage

Install using standard Vagrant 1.1+ plugin installation methods. After
installing, `vagrant up` and specify the `openstack` provider. An example is
shown below.

```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-openstack-provider
...
$ vagrant up --provider=openstack
...
```

Of course prior to doing this, you'll need to obtain an Openstack-compatible
box file for Vagrant.

### CentOS / RHEL (sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo)

The default configuration of the RHEL family of Linux distributions requires a tty in order to run sudo. Vagrant does not connect with a tty by default, so you may experience the error:
> sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo

The best way to take deal with this error is to upgrade to Vagrant 1.4 or later, and enable:
```
config.ssh.pty = true
```

## Quick Start

After installing the plugin (instructions above), the quickest way to get
started is to actually use a dummy Openstack box and specify all the details
manually within a `config.vm.provider` block. So first, add the dummy
box using any name you want:

```
$ vagrant box add dummy https://github.com/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack-provider/raw/master/source/dummy.box
...
```

And then make a Vagrantfile that looks like the following, filling in
your information where necessary.

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "dummy"

  config.vm.provider :openstack do |rs|
    rs.username = "YOUR USERNAME"
    rs.password = "YOUR API KEY"
    rs.flavor   = /1 GB Performance/
    rs.image    = /Ubuntu/
  end
end
```

And then run `vagrant up --provider=openstack`.

This will start an Ubuntu 12.04 instance in the DFW datacenter region within
your account. And assuming your SSH information was filled in properly
within your Vagrantfile, SSH and provisioning will work as well.

Note that normally a lot of this boilerplate is encoded within the box
file, but the box file used for the quick start, the "dummy" box, has
no preconfigured defaults.

## Box Format

Every provider in Vagrant must introduce a custom box format. This
provider introduces `openstack` boxes. You can view an example box in
the [example_box/ directory](https://github.com/ggiamarchi/vagrant-openstack/tree/master/source/example_box).
That directory also contains instructions on how to build a box.

The box format is basically just the required `metadata.json` file
along with a `Vagrantfile` that does default settings for the
provider-specific configuration for this provider.

## Configuration

This provider exposes quite a few provider-specific configuration options:

* `username` - The username with which to access Openstack.
* `password` - The API key for accessing Openstack.
* `tenant_name` - The Openstack project name to work on
* `flavor` - The name of the flavor to use for the VM
* `image` - The name of the image to use for the VM
* `openstack_compute_url` - The compute_url to hit. This is good for custom endpoints.
* `openstack_auth_url` - The endpoint to authentication against. By default, vagrant will use the global
openstack authentication endpoint for all regions with the exception of :lon. IF :lon region is specified
vagrant will authenticate against the UK authentication endpoint.
* `keypair_name` - The name of the key pair register in nova to associate with the VM. The public key should
  be the matching pair for the private key configured with `config.ssh.private_key_path` on Vagrant.
* `ssh_username` - Username used by Vagrant for ssh login.
* `floating_ip` - The floating IP to associate with the VM. This IP must be formerly allocated.
* `server_name` - The name of the server within Openstack Cloud. This
  defaults to the name of the Vagrant machine (via `config.vm.define`), but
  can be overridden with this.
* `networks` - Network list the server must be connected on. Can be omitted if only one private network exists
  in the Openstack project
* `sync_method` - Specify the synchronization method for shared folder between the host and the remote VM.
  Currently, it can be "rsync" or "none". The default value is "rsync". If your Openstack image does not
  include rsync, you must set this parameter to "none".
* `rsync_includes` - If `sync_method` is set to "rsync", this parameter give the list of local folders to sync
  on the remote VM.

These can be set like typical provider-specific configuration:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # ... other stuff

  config.vm.provider :openstack do |rs|
    rs.username = "mitchellh"
    rs.password = "foobarbaz"
  end
end
```

## Networks

Networking features in the form of `config.vm.network` are not
supported with `vagrant-openstack`, currently. If any of these are
specified, Vagrant will emit a warning, but will otherwise boot
the Openstack server.

You can provide network id or name. However, in Openstack the network name is not unique, thus if there is two networks with
the same name in your project the plugin will fail. If so, you have to use only ids.

Here's an example which adds two Cloud Networks. The first by id and the second by name.

```ruby
config.vm.provider :openstack do |rs|
  ...
  rs.networks = ['443aff42-be57-effb-ad30-c097c1e4503f', 'backend-network']
  ...
end
```

## Synced Folders

There is minimal support for synced folders. Upon `vagrant up`,
`vagrant reload`, and `vagrant provision`, the Openstack provider will use
`rsync` (if available) to uni-directionally sync the folder to
the remote machine over SSH.

This is good enough for all built-in Vagrant provisioners (shell,
chef, and puppet) to work!

## Development

To work on the `vagrant-openstack` plugin, clone this repository out, and use
[Bundler](http://gembundler.com) to get the dependencies:

```
$ bundle
```

Once you have the dependencies, verify the unit tests pass with `rake`:

```
$ bundle exec rake
```

If those pass, you're ready to start developing the plugin. You can test
the plugin without installing it into your Vagrant environment by just
creating a `Vagrantfile` in the top level of this directory (it is gitignored)
that uses it, and uses bundler to execute Vagrant:

```
$ bundle exec vagrant up --provider=openstack
```

## Logging

To enable all Vagrant logs set environment variable `VAGRANT_LOG` to the desire
log level (for instance `VAGRANT_LOG=debug`). If you want only Openstack provider
logs use the variable `VAGRANT_OPENSTACK_LOG`. if both variables are set, `VAGRANT_LOG`
takes precedence.
